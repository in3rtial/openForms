# Open Forms


## What?

We are trying to bring out in the open as much of the commonly used
psychology self-evalution tests and their interpretation, based on
the actual research, with proper reference along with visualization/analysis
tools.

It doesn't aim for the same niche as PEBL for example. It is just a way to speed-up
testing and assessments by psychologists on common tests. 

## Why?

Most commonly used psychology sheets are filled and evaluated by hand.
Why is it so? Because it's probably not worth developing those sheets when
you don't actually program as a job and some of them are copyrighted.

The first part isn't a problem. The second one might be, we'll see.

## How can I contribute?
The most pressing issues will likely be those:
- code reviews (validation, user experience reviews)
- test suggestions
